# Introduction
‘I’ (The Balance) is an immersive installation about the philosophy of change. Inspired by I Ching, an ancient Chinese philosophical document, the artwork explores the conservation between everything in the world. Motion and stillness permeates objects from virtual world to physical world. Stillness can be seen as a dynamic change as well.
