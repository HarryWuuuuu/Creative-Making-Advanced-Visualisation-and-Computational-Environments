# Introduction
‘I’ (The Balance) is an immersive installation about the philosophy of change. Inspired by I Ching, an ancient Chinese philosophical document, the artwork explores the conservation between everything in the world. Motion and stillness permeates objects from virtual world to physical world. Stillness can be seen as a dynamic change as well.
In the experience, audiences can interact with the virtual character by body movement. The virtual and physical environment will react audiences’ motion by wind. The balance borns within the virtual space, the physical space, audiences and character.

# Design of Installation
1. When player moves away from the fan, the fan will work, otherwise it doesn't work. The wind can blow up the organza, visualizing the flow of wind in the space when player walks.
2. The distance between the player and the character is always the same. When player move away from the screen, the character will close to the screen. Otherwise the character will move away from the screen. The distance from the screen, or the location of player/character, indicates how people balance their state between virtual world and pyhsical world. For instance, if player closes to the screen, it means that player prefers the virtual world. If player moves away from the screen, they prefer the physical world.
3. The changing direction of organza in virtual world is the same as the moving direction of character. Organza is a form of wind visualization. It makes wind flow between the virtual world and physical world. It also implies the balance of the wind element between the virtual and the real.

# My Work
I am mainly responsible for the coding part, including:
1. The blueprint of Kinect in Unreal.
2. The communication between Unreal and Kinect.
3. The communication between Unreal, Kinect and Arduino.
4. The communication between Kinect and virtual organza.
5. The final effect adjustment.

# Project Link
Due to the large size of the original project file, I upload all project files to the Google Drive.
